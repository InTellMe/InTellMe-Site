## Typography

### Font System

| Role | Font | Purpose | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| Primary Logo | EB Garamond | The "Old Money" of typography. Elegant, classic serif. | Looks like it was printed on 100lb bond paper in a high-end lab. |
| Headings | Playfair Display | High contrast and sophisticated. | Use for the big "InTellMe" or project titles to signal authority and depth. |
| Body / Research | Libre Baskerville | Optimized for screen readability with the weight of a physical book. | Says the content is worth reading carefully. |
| "Notebook" Accent | Nanum Brush Script | Handwritten marginalia effect. | Use sparingly for "Author's Notes" or "Insight" callouts. |
